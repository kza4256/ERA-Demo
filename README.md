# ERA-Demo
This MATLAB script uses ERA to estimate a dynamical system's state-space model from input-output data. It includes functions to compute the Hankel matrix, perform SVD, and truncate SVD for model reduction. The inferred model is then used to predict the system's output, and the Frobenius error between the predicted and true outputs is calculated.
